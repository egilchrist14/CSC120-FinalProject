Reflection
Partner: Lizzie DelMonico

Since we were making a game based off of Greed Island from Hunter X Hunter, our approach was to base the game around the different locations you can visit on the island and which characters you interact with in each one, and then code based on that idea. I became more comfortable with most of the concepts we learned in this class while working on our project. If there was more time, I think I would have wanted to add graphics and music. For my past self I would tell her to focus on thinking specifically within the realms of object-oriented programming and start from there because I think a big challenge for me throughout this class has been the difficulty it is or me to start a project from this kind of programming. In terms of team dynamics, Lizzie and I worked on our final project together in CSC 110 as well so we're alrwady pretty familiar with how we work together, so making time out of class to work together was easy which made everything but especially the early stages go smoother.
